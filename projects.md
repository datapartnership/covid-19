# ðŸ’¡ Projects

A **collection** curated by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org) of COVID-19 focused projects.

## Economic Anxiety and COVID-19 in Southeast Asia The Fragility, Conflict, and Violence

> The project team t the World Bank analyzed how COVID-19 cases fuel the economic
anxiety in ASEAN countries -Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Philippines, and Vietnam. Google Search Trends for distinct categories, including
Aid, Assistance, Debt, Government, and Unemployment, were analyzed. The team
showed that search trends could give policymakers real-time insights into the
growing anxiety due to COVID-19 cases and reactions to fiscal policies.

## Cities, Crowding, and the Coronavirus: Predicting Contagion Risk Hotspots

> The exponential growth of Covid-19 cases globally has shown us how vital it is to
identify and anticipate the emerging contagion hotspots to limit the spread of the
virus. Leveraging Facebookâ€™s Population Density Maps, WorldPop population data,
DLR's World Settlement Footprint 3D product, and Open Street Map, the World Bank
developed a methodology that identifies hotspots for contagion and vulnerability.

## The Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures on Internet Speed

> The World Bank Digital Development team used Ookla's Speedtest data to analyze the effect of
COVID-19-related lockdown measures on internet speed in a sample of developing
countries in Africa. The findings of the study demonstrate the resiliency of digital
infrastructure in Africa and highlight the benefits of partnerships between public
and private stakeholders to manage traffic surges.

## Understanding the Post COVID-19 Labor Market in Latin America and the Caribbean

> The Inter-American Development Bankâ€™s Covid-19 Labor Observatory
used LinkedIn hiring rate data and household surveys to analyze hiring rate
fluctuations in different sectors across Latin America and the Caribbean. LinkedInâ€™s
data has been complementing traditional labor dynamics statistics to understand
better the Covid-19 impact in the region.

## Digitalization and Resilience to COVID-19 Shocks: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa

> The IMF used household surveys (High-Frequency Phone Surveys on COVID-19)
and Ookla's CoverageRightâ„¢ data to assess whether households with mobile
connectivity withstood COVID-19 shocks better regarding income, employment,
food security, and education in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that digital
connectivity enhanced households' resilience to shocks during the pandemic in
three areas: market access, employment, and human capital development.

## Analyzing Spatial Accessibility of Health Facilities in Indonesia and Philippines

> Using the Mapbox API, Facebook Population Density Maps, and OpenStreetMap POIs,
the Development Data Partnership team examined how physically accessible
hospitals and clinics are in Indonesia and the Philippines. The team generated maps
that show the percentage of a population in a study region that cannot reach a
health facility within 1 hour of travel time by mode.

## Improving Public Space and Market Design During COVID-19

> The Inter-American Development Bank levered Verasetâ€™s Movement data to support
the Municipality of Lima in its effort to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, while
ensuring that markets and public spaces could continue to function. The team
analyzed visitorsâ€™ movements through market areas, identifying origin districts and
activity hotspots throughout the day. By comparing pre-and post-pandemic flows,
the team was able to inform a new design for these public spaces, and the method
developed by the team will be shared as a public good.

## COVID and Flood Resilient Transport in Chennai

> The World Bank South Asia Transport Team conducted an urban mobility diagnostic
using data from Unacast, Facebookâ€™s Relative Wealth Index among other sources to
understand transport issues in the city, quantify the impacts from Cyclone Nivar and
the impacts of COVID-19 on mobility. The team leveraged Mobilkit - a Python Toolkit
developed by the World Bank for Urban Resilience and Disaster Risk Management
Analytics using High Frequency Human Mobility Data which has been used across
many countries and World Bank projects, (e.g., Mexico, Costa Rica, Nepal.
